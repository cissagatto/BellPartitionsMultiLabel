# BellPartitionsMultiLabel
This code generates partitions based on bell numbers for multilabel classification. This code is part of my doctoral research. Important: when executing in Linux, this code uses the folder "/dev/shm" to reduce I/O process.

## Scripts
This source code consists of an R project for R Studio and the following R scripts:

1. libraries
2. utils
3. BellPartitionsMultiLabel
4. run
5. bpm

## Multi-Label Datasets
You can download the multi-label datasets at this link: https://cometa.ujaen.es/datasets/

## Preparing your experiment

### Step-1
This code is executed in X-fold cross-validation. First, you have to obtain the X-fold cross-validation files using this code: https://github.com/cissagatto/CrossValidationMultiLabel (all the instructions to use the code are in the Github). After that, put the results generated in the *datasets* folder in this project. The folder structure generated by the code CrossValidation is used here. This code don't work without theses files. (see the following image)

### Step-2
Confirms if the folder *utils* contains the following files: *Clus.jar*, *R_csv_2_arff.jar*, and *weka.jar*, and also the folder *lib* with *commons-math-1.0.jar*, *jgap.jar*, weka.jar and *Clus.jar.* Without these jars, the code not runs. 

### Step-3
Place a copy of this code in _C:/Users/[username]/Local-Clus-TVT or _/home/[username]/Local-Clus-TVT. Our files are configured to obtain the paths of the folders from this path. You can change this in the code if you want.

### Step-4
A file called _datasets.csv_ must be in the *root project* folder. This file is used to read information about the datasets and they are used in the code. All 74 datasets available in *Cometa* are in this file. If you want to use another dataset, please, add the following information about the dataset in the file:

_Id, Name, Domain, Labels, Instances, Attributes, Inputs, Labelsets, Single, Max freq, Card, Dens, MeanIR, Scumble, TCS, AttStart, AttEnd, LabelStart, LabelEnd, xn, yn, gridn_

The *Id* of the dataset is a mandatory parameter in the command line to run all code. The fields are used in a lot of internal functions. Please, make sure that this information is available before running the code. *xn* and *yn* correspond to a dimension of the quadrangular map for kohonen, and *gridn* is (xn * yn). Example: xn = 4, yn = 4, gridn = 16.


## Folder Structure

## Software Requirements
This code was develop in RStudio Version 1.4.1106 © 2009-2021 RStudio, PBC "Tiger Daylily" (2389bc24, 2021-02-11) for Ubuntu Bionic Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) QtWebEngine/5.12.8 Chrome/69.0.3497.128 Safari/537.36. The R Language version was: R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) -- "Camp Pontanezen" Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit).

**Please, make sure all the dependencies are installed (verify libraries.R). This code does not provide any installation of the packages.**

## Hardware Requirements
This code may or may not be executed in parallel, however, it is highly recommended that you run it in parallel. The number of cores can be configured via the command line (number_cores). If number_cores = 1 the code will run sequentially. In our experiments, we used 10 cores. For reproducibility, we recommend that you also use ten cores. This code was tested with the birds dataset in the following machine:

*System:*

Host: bionote | Kernel: 5.8.0-53-generic | x86_64 bits: 64 | Desktop: Gnome 3.36.7 | Distro: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (Focal Fossa)

*CPU:*

Topology: 6-Core | model: Intel Core i7-10750H | bits: 64 | type: MT MCP | L2 cache: 12.0 MiB | Speed: 800 MHz | min/max: 800/5000 MHz Core speeds (MHz): | 1: 800 | 2: 800 | 3: 800 | 4: 800 | 5: 800 | 6: 800 | 7: 800 | 8: 800 | 9: 800 | 10: 800 | 11: 800 | 12: 800 |

Then the experiment was executed in a cluster at UFSCar.

Important: we used the CLUS classifier in this experiment. This implies generating all physical ARFF training, validating, and testing files for each of the generated random partitions. Our code generates the partitions first in memory and then saves them to the HD. However, to avoid memory problems, immediately after saving to HD, the files are validated (or tested) and then deleted. Even so, make sure you have enough space on your HD and RAM for this procedure.


# Run

```
Rscript bpm.R [number_dataset] [folderResult]
```

Example:

```
Rscript bpm.R 1 "/dev/shm/res"
```

## Results
Three files are generated as result:

**[dataset_name]-countPartitions.csv**: Returns the frequency of groups. For example group 1 appears only 1 time while group 3 appears 6 times.
| groups | total | 
| ------ | ----- | 
|   1    |   1   | 
|   2    |   7   | 
|   3    |   6   | 
|   4    |   1   | 

**[dataset_name]-groupsPerPartitions.csv**: Returns the number of groups for each partition. For example partition 2, 3 and 4 has 2 groups while partition 1 only one.
| part | totalGroups | 
| ---- | ----------- | 
|   1  |      1      | 
|   2  |      2      |  
|   3  |      2      |  
|   4  |      2      |  

**[dataset_name]-partitions.csv**: Returns the label distributions in each partition. For example: in partition 12 the Label1 and Label2 are located in group 1 while Label3 and Label4 are in group 2.
| id | part | group | id_labels |  labels  |
| -- | ---- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
|  1 |  12  |   1   |     1     | "Label1" |
|  2 |  12  |   1   |     2     | "Label2" |
|  3 |  12  |   2   |     3     | "Label3" |
|  4 |  12  |   2   |     4     | "Label4" |

The results are store in the Reports folder, like the follow image

## Software Requirements
This code was develop in R Studio Version 1.3.959 © 2009-2020, PBC, "Middlemist Red" (3a09be39, 2020-05-18) for Windows. The R language version was 4.0.1 (2020-06-06) with x86_64-w64-mingw32 platform. Please make sure all the dependencies are installed (verify libraries.R). This code does not provide an installation of R packages.

## Hardware Requirements
This code was tested in a laptop with 16,0GB RAM and a processor Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40 GHz for datasets with less than 8 labels in label space. With you want to test datasets with more than 8 labels, it is recommended that you use a cluster with high available RAM.
